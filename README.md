# GNN-For-Scalar-Field-Prediction
This project investigates sparse linear algebra in a 3D Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the scalar field. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) leverages a k-NN graph with a sparse adjacency matrix, where we observe its performance from mean squared errors in different precisions.
